# ðŸŽ¨ FavoriteColorNFT

An **NFT project** built with Solidity and OpenZeppelin that allows users to **mint their favorite color** as a unique token on the Ethereum blockchain.

---

## ðŸ§  Project Description

**FavoriteColorNFT** is a fun and simple **ERC-721 NFT smart contract** that lets users **mint a color (in HEX format)** as their very own NFT.  
Each color can only be minted **once**, ensuring that every hue on-chain is truly **unique** â€” just like its owner.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Users can **mint** their favorite color by entering a **HEX color code** (e.g., `#FF5733`).  
- The contract ensures that **no two people can mint the same color**.  
- Each color is linked to a unique **token ID**, representing ownership.  
- Owners can **view** their minted colors and see how many total colors have been created.
